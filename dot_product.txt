EndProcedure

Algorithm Orthogonality_Checking:

     n is (dimension of vectors)
     m  is (number of pairs to test)

    For k from 1 to m do
        Read vector v1 of size n
        Read vector v2 of size n

        Call procedure:
        dot_product(v1, v2, n, ps)

        If ps = 0 then
            Print "Vectors are orthogonal"
        Else
            Print "Vectors are NOT orthogonal"
        EndIf
    EndFor
EndAlgorithm

replace procedure by fonction:
Function dot_product(v1, v2, n)
    ps = 0
    For i from 1 to n do
        ps  = ps + (v1[i] * v2[i])
    EndFor
    Return ps
EndFunction
